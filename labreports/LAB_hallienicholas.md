# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [f ] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [ ] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve central is an application which stores information about service activities and locations on the database and allows for users to see what opportunities are around them to serve the community. Along with being able to find an event, users can sign up for the event through the app as well which ensures a smooth overall experience, and is an easy way for people to learn about service opportunities and events.
