# Step 1: Confirm Lab Setup
- [x] I have forked the repository and created my lab report
- [x] I have reviewed the [lecture / discsussion](../assets/04p1_SolutionArchitectures.pdf) on architecture patterns.
- [x] If I'm collaborating on this project, I have included their handles on the report and confirm that my report is informed, but not copied from my collaborators.

# Step 2: Analyze the Proposal
Serve central is an application which stores information about service activities and locations on the database and allows for users to see what opportunities are around them to serve the community. Along with being able to find an event, users can sign up for the event through the app as well which ensures a smooth overall experience, and is an easy way for people to learn about service opportunities and events.

## Step 2.1 Representative Use Cases  

| Use Case #1 | |
|---|---|
| Title | As a volunteer I can look for service opportunities so I can be helpful and give my time to others.|
| Description / Steps | This use case describes how the volunteer finds a service opportunity based on location and signs up through the service.|
| Primary Actor | Volunteer|
| Preconditions | 1. Volunteer is signed in 2. Volunteer needs an opportunity 3. Location access is enabled on user's phone|
| Postconditions | 1. Volunteer is sent a confirmation of signup 2. Volunteer has an opportunity|

| Use Case #2 | |
|---|---|
| Title | As the service agency, I can list a hosted event so I can have a good number of volunteers help out. |
| Description / Steps | Agency is looking for volunteers and gives their information to the application's database|
| Primary Actor | Service Agencies |
| Preconditions | 1. Service agency must be looking for volunteers 2. Agency must be hosting an event|
| Postconditions | 1. Agency hosts the event 2. Agency of notified of signups|

## Step 2.2 Define the MVC Components

| Model | View | Controller |
|---|---|---|
| Service events listed in database | Event page in the program | Ability for volunteers to sign up for events|
| Reporting function | Information about each reported event | Record of each event our service receives info about |
| User accounts | Login page | Ability to store password and user info |
|  |  |  |

# Step 3: Enhancing an Architecture

## Step 3.1 Architecture Change Proposal
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the two new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.

## Step 3.2 Revised Architecture Diagram
INSERT IMAGE HERE with a Description.

# Step 4: Scaling an Architecture
INSERT Architectural change proposal here, and how it meets the four new requirements.  Explain both the benefits and draw backs of your proposal.  If the changes are significant, then you need to explain why the changes are necessary versus a nice-to-have enhancement.
